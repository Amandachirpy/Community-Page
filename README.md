# Community-Page

# About Us
Okota Devs started as a community of budding developers from #ALCwithGoogle3.0 meet ups that are carrying on with building their careers after #GoogleAfricaScholarship in 2018 ended.
Okota Devs currently number in around a dozen and have regular online group discussions to help each other with coding problems and ensure all members are aware of the lastest opportunities in the software development ecosystem amongst other activities.

# Goals
Steadily build a community profile with an attached portfolio that members can use as a reference for their profiles/portfolio.
